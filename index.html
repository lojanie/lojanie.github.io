    <h1>Join us at The Love Trunk</h1>
    <p>It’s time to sweep the winter blues of January aside and come together again, celebrating love in its multitude of shapes and sizes.</p>
    <p>Through the newly formed non-profit Éléphantastique, join us for a valentine’s-themed dance party.
        It will get sappy, sweaty, but most of all, groovy, baby.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Kicking the night off right we’ll have Alinea, with his trusted magical voice and instrumentalizing to carry us along an acoustic serenade
        Next, the lights dim and the DJs begin: find L-PAD, Lojanie, and Grid providing anything from soul, funk, and disco to techno, house, and gosh knows what else. Come find out for yourself.
        </p>
    <p>Dare we ask you to throw on a garment from your tickle trunk? Your costume box? That silly corner of your closet? Those heart shaped sunnies collecting dust, at the very least?</p>
    <p>This event is BYOB. The letter writing station will be returning. Location deets shared upon ticket purchase.
