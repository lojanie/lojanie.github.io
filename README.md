# Join us at The Love Trunk

It’s time to sweep the winter blues of January aside and come together again, celebrating love in its multitude of shapes and sizes. 

Through the newly formed non-profit Éléphantastique, join us for a valentine’s-themed dance party.  It will get sappy, sweaty, but most of all, groovy, baby.

Kicking the night off right we’ll have Alinea, with his trusted magical voice and instrumentalizing to carry us along an acoustic serenade
Next, the lights dim and the DJs begin: find L-PAD, Lojanie, and Grid providing anything from soul, funk, and disco to techno, house, and gosh knows what else. Come find out for yourself.

Dare we ask you to throw on a garment from your tickle trunk? Your costume box? That silly corner of your closet? Those heart shaped sunnies collecting dust, at the very least?

This event is BYOB. The letter writing station will be returning :) Stay tuned for location deets. 


Can’t wait to see y’all on the dance floor.

MORE ON THE PERFORMERS:


Lojanie

Rising from Sopranos soil and calling Canada home for the last decade, DJ Lojanie aims to elicit joy and movement in those listening. Drawing inspiration from Balearic House’s eclectic formula, she builds a mosaic of global sounds blending cosmic dance, disco, and deep house.

L-PAD

Although the host of a biweekly program on N10.as exploring the ambient and experimental, LPAD secretly yearns for the dance floor. A longtime lover of acid, techno, house of all vintages, he aims to bring a more lively and punchy atmosphere than usual - although not without a few curve-balls.

Grid

Casual music selector from Lebanon, Grid likes to make every set a reflection of her current finds, from disco, funk to house and pop. She has a mission to dig and discover classical and reworked music from the arab world. Tune in for an eclectic journey! 
Some special love themed tunes will be on the menu, expect to hear the songs you sing to in the showers!
